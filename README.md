## ⚡ Edge Detection

|  | Feature | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 📐 | **Normal CDF Model** | Spread/total probabilities via bell curve with sport-specific stdev |
| ⚖️ | **Sharp Book Weighting** | Pinnacle 3x, DraftKings 0.7x — sharp lines pull consensus |
| 📈 | **Team Stats** | ESPN/NHL/MLB win% validates or challenges book fair value |
| 💰 | **Sharp Money** | ESPN open-vs-close odds detect reverse line movement |
| 🌧️ | **Weather** | NWS forecasts for 61 NFL/MLB venues adjust total expectations |
| ⚠️ | **Book Disagreement** | \>4pt spread range across books flags injury news |
| 📊 | **CLV Tracking** | Closing line value validates model accuracy over time |

> \[!IMPORTANT\]  
> Every scan defaults to **preview mode**. No money is risked until you pass `--execute`.

## 🛡️ Risk & Position Sizing

### Quarter-Kelly Sizing

Bet size scales with edge strength. Higher-edge opportunities get more capital; marginal edges stay at the minimum unit. This is the core differentiator — flat sizing leaves money on the table.

text

Copy

text

Copy

```
bet_size = max(unit_size, 0.25 × edge × bankroll)
```

| Edge | Bankroll $50 | Contracts @ $0.40 | vs Flat ($0.50 unit) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3% | $0.38 | 1 (flat floor) | Same |
| 8% | $1.00 | 3 | 2x more |
| 15% | $1.88 | 5 | 4x more |
| 25% | $3.13 | 8 | 7x more |

The result is capped by max bet size ($50 sports / $100 prediction), max concentration (20% of bankroll), and available balance.

### 9 Risk Gates

Every order must pass all nine gates before execution:

|  | Gate | What it blocks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Daily loss limit** | No new bets after -$250 today |
| 2 | **Position count** | Max 10 concurrent open positions |
| 3 | **Edge threshold** | Minimum 3% edge required |
| 4 | **Composite score** | Must score 6.0+ across edge, confidence, liquidity |
| 5 | **Confidence floor** | Medium or higher — requires 5+ books agreeing |
| 6 | **Duplicate check** | Can’t double up on the same market |
| 7 | **Per-event cap** | Max 3 positions on the same game |
| 8 | **Concentration limit** | No single position > 20% of bankroll |
| 9 | **Bet size cap** | $50/sports, $100/prediction hard ceiling |

All limits are configurable via `.env`. See [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for details on how scoring, confidence, and sizing interact.

## 🚀 Quick Start

bash

Copy

bash

Copy

```bash
# 1. Install and configurepip install -r requirements.txtcp .env.example .env # fill in KALSHI_API_KEY, ODDS_API_KEYS# 2. Scan for opportunities (preview only)python scripts/scan.py sports --filter nba# 3. Execute after reviewingpython scripts/scan.py sports --filter nba --execute --unit-size 1 --max-bets 5# 4. Settle and check P&Lpython scripts/kalshi/kalshi_settler.py report --detail --save
```

> \[!TIP\]  
> All scanners share the same flags: `--execute`, `--unit-size`, `--max-bets`, `--pick`, `--ticker`, `--save`, `--date`, `--exclude-open`. Use `--date tomorrow --exclude-open` to avoid double-betting.

## 🤖 Claude Code Skill

Edge-Radar includes a built-in `/edge-radar` slash command for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) that provides a natural language interface to the entire system. Type `/edge-radar` followed by what you want to do:

text

Copy

text

Copy

```
/edge-radar status                          # Balance, open positions, P&L/edge-radar scan nba                        # Preview NBA opportunities/edge-radar bet mlb --unit-size 1           # Scan MLB + execute on confirm/edge-radar settle                          # Settle bets + P&L report/edge-radar risk                            # Full risk dashboard/edge-radar detail KXNBAGAME-26APR01-...    # Deep dive on a single market/edge-radar crypto --cross-ref              # Prediction markets + Polymarket xref
```

The skill routes natural language to the correct scanner, enforces all risk gates, and always previews before executing. All flags (`--date`, `--exclude-open`, `--pick`, `--save`, etc.) work inline. Or just describe what you want in plain English — Claude handles the routing.

> \[!NOTE\]  
> Requires [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) CLI, Desktop, or IDE extension. The skill is defined in `.claude/skills/edge-radar/SKILL.md`.
> 
> **Using Gemini CLI or OpenAI Codex?** The `/edge-radar` slash command is Claude Code-specific, but the commands and workflows are the same. Add the skill content from `.claude/skills/edge-radar/SKILL.md` to your `GEMINI.md` or `AGENTS.md` file to get equivalent functionality in those tools.

## 🔄 Automated Daily Execution

Pre-built scripts scan NFL, NBA, NHL, and MLB in a single command, rank the top 10 opportunities across all sports by composite score, and execute with Kelly sizing.

bash

Copy

bash

Copy

```bash
# Preview today's best picks (no bets placed)scripts\schedulers\same_day_executions\same_day_scan.bat# Scan + execute (places live orders via Kalshi API)scripts\schedulers\same_day_executions\same_day_execute.bat
```

**Recommended schedule:** 8 AM ET via Windows Task Scheduler. By 8 AM, all markets are posted, sportsbooks have sharpened lines overnight, and Kalshi’s lag window is open.

bash

Copy

bash

Copy

```bash
schtasks /Create /TN "Edge-Radar\Daily" /TR "path\to\same_day_execute.bat" /SC DAILY /ST 08:00
```

Reports save to `reports/Sports/schedulers/same-day-executions/` with full execution details (Sport, Bet, Type, Pick, Qty, Price, Cost, Edge).
